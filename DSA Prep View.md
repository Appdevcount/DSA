# Big O Cheat Sheet ‚Äì Time Complexity Chart

**Author:** Joel Olawanle  

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions for solving a specific problem. You can solve these problems in various ways.

This means that the method you use to arrive at the same solution may differ from mine, but we should both get the same result.

Because there are various ways to solve a problem, there must be a way to evaluate these solutions or algorithms in terms of performance and efficiency (the time it will take for your algorithm to run/execute and the total amount of memory it will consume).

This is critical for programmers to ensure that their applications run properly and to help them write clean code.

This is where **Big O Notation** enters the picture. Big O Notation is a metric for determining the efficiency of an algorithm. It allows you to estimate how long your code will run on different sets of inputs and measure how effectively your code scales as the size of your input increases.

---

## What is Big O?

Big O, also known as **Big O notation**, represents an algorithm's worst-case complexity. It uses algebraic terms to describe the complexity of an algorithm.

Big O defines the runtime required to execute an algorithm by identifying how the performance of your algorithm will change as the input size grows. But it does not tell you how fast your algorithm's runtime is.

Big O notation measures the efficiency and performance of your algorithm using **time** and **space complexity**.

---

## What is Time and Space Complexity?

One major underlying factor affecting your program's performance and efficiency is the hardware, OS, and CPU you use.

But you don't consider this when you analyze an algorithm's performance. Instead, the **time** and **space complexity** as a function of the input's size are what matters.

- **Time complexity** specifies how long it will take to execute an algorithm as a function of its input size.  
- **Space complexity** specifies the total amount of space or memory required to execute an algorithm as a function of the size of the input.

We will be focusing on **time complexity** in this guide.

---

## Why is time complexity a function of its input size?

To perfectly grasp the concept of "as a function of input size," imagine you have an algorithm that computes the sum of numbers based on your input.  

If your input is 4, it will add `1+2+3+4` to output 10; if your input is 5, it will output 15 (meaning `1+2+3+4+5`).

```csharp
int CalculateSum(int input)
{
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= input; i++)
    {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}
````

![Loop execution diagram](image1.png)

Looking at the image above, we only have three statements. Still, because there is a loop, the second statement will be executed based on the input size, so if the input is four, the second statement will be executed four times, meaning the entire algorithm will run six (4 + 2) times.

In plain terms, the algorithm will run `input + 2` times, where input can be any number. This shows that it's expressed in terms of the input. In other words, it is a function of the input size.

---

## Major Types of Time Complexity

* **Constant:** `O(1)`
* **Linear time:** `O(n)`
* **Logarithmic time:** `O(log n)`
* **Quadratic time:** `O(n^2)`
* **Exponential time:** `O(2^n)`
* **Factorial time:** `O(n!)`

---

## Big O Complexity Chart

The Big O chart, also known as the Big O graph, is an asymptotic notation used to express the complexity of an algorithm or its performance as a function of input size.

This helps programmers identify and fully understand the worst-case scenario and the execution time or memory required by an algorithm.

![Big O Complexity Graph](image2.png)

The chart above shows:

* `O(1)` ‚Äì **Excellent/Best**
* `O(log n)` ‚Äì **Good**
* `O(n)` ‚Äì **Fair**
* `O(n log n)` ‚Äì **Bad**
* `O(n^2)`, `O(2^n)`, `O(n!)` ‚Äì **Horrible/Worst**

---

### Rules of Thumb

* **O(1):** Not dependent on input size.
* **O(log n):** Input size is reduced by half each step.
* **O(n):** Single loop.
* **O(n^2):** Nested loops.
* **O(2^n):** Doubles with each addition to input.

---

# Big O Time Complexity Examples

---

## Constant Time: `O(1)`

When your algorithm is **not** dependent on the input size `n`, it is constant time.

```csharp
T FirstElement<T>(List<T> list)
{
    return list[0];
}

var scores = new List<int> { 12, 55, 67, 94, 22 };
Console.WriteLine(FirstElement(scores)); // 12
```

Even with 1 million elements, this will take the same time.

---

## Linear Time: `O(n)`

Runtime increases proportionally with input size.

```csharp
long CalcFactorial(int n)
{
    long factorial = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    {
        factorial *= i;
    }
    return factorial;
}

Console.WriteLine(CalcFactorial(5)); // 120
```

---

## Logarithmic Time: `O(log n)`

Input size reduces by half each step (e.g., binary search).

```csharp
int BinarySearch(int[] array, int target)
{
    int firstIndex = 0;
    int lastIndex = array.Length - 1;

    while (firstIndex <= lastIndex)
    {
        int middleIndex = (firstIndex + lastIndex) / 2;

        if (array[middleIndex] == target)
            return middleIndex;

        if (array[middleIndex] > target)
            lastIndex = middleIndex - 1;
        else
            firstIndex = middleIndex + 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

int[] scores = { 12, 22, 45, 67, 96 };
Console.WriteLine(BinarySearch(scores, 96)); // 4
```

---

## Quadratic Time: `O(n^2)`

Nested loops cause runtime to grow as the square of input size.

```csharp
string MatchElements(List<string> list)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < list.Count; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < list.Count; j++)
        {
            if (i != j && list[i] == list[j])
            {
                return $"Match found at {i} and {j}";
            }
        }
    }
    return "No matches found üòû";
}

var fruits = new List<string> { "üçì", "üçê", "üçä", "üçå", "üçç", "üçë", "üçé", "üçà", "üçä", "üçá" };
Console.WriteLine(MatchElements(fruits));
```

---

## Exponential Time: `O(2^n)`

Growth rate doubles with each additional input unit.

```csharp
int RecursiveFibonacci(int n)
{
    if (n < 2)
        return n;
    return RecursiveFibonacci(n - 1) + RecursiveFibonacci(n - 2);
}

Console.WriteLine(RecursiveFibonacci(6)); // 8
```

* What time complexity is.
* How Big O notation measures algorithm efficiency.

Do you want me to **also make this into a clean, color-coded PDF schedule** so it looks like a study planner? That would make it much easier to follow visually.


The YouTube video "How I Mastered Data Structures and Algorithms" by Ashish Pratap Singh provides a comprehensive guide and strategy for effectively mastering DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) for coding interviews at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Key points covered in the video for DSA guidance are:

- **Must-Know DSA Topics:**  
  - Data Structures: Linear (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables) and Non-linear (trees, binary search trees, heaps, graphs, trie, union find). Start with linear before nonlinear.  
  - Algorithms: Sorting, binary search, bit manipulation, tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order), graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, topological sort, shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford).  
  - Problem Solving Techniques: Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sum, fast and slow pointers, divide and conquer, greedy, recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, and top k elements techniques.  
  - Optional advanced topics like segment trees and fenwick trees are good to know but not essential initially.  
  - Also important is understanding time and space complexity analysis.

- **Learning Strategy:**  
  - Focus on *one topic at a time* to avoid overwhelm.  
  - Don‚Äôt need to fully master a topic before moving on, but understand its core, implement it from scratch, and solve easy related problems on platforms like LeetCode.  
  - Recommended order:  
    1. Linear data structures  
    2. Popular algorithms and problem-solving patterns (two pointers, sliding window, recursion, backtracking, bit manipulation)  
    3. Hierarchical data structures (trees, BST, tries, heaps)  
    4. More complex algorithms (greedy, dynamic programming)  
    5. Graphs and union find.

- **How to Start Learning a New Topic:**  
  1. Learn basics‚Äîwhat it is, code representation, operations, time/space complexity.  
  2. Understand real-world applications (e.g., graphs for Google Maps).  
  3. Visualize with pen and paper‚Äîdraw diagrams, write pseudocode.  
  4. Implement from scratch in your preferred language.  
  5. Learn built-in libraries for popular data structures in your language.  
  6. Solve easy related problems to build confidence.

- **Mastering a DSA Topic:**  
  1. Prioritize solving problems rather than only theory.  
  2. Challenge yourself with gradually harder problems (easy ‚Üí medium ‚Üí hard).  
  3. Understand solutions rather than memorizing them. If stuck, draw or explain the logic to deeply grasp it.  
  4. Think in patterns ‚Äî recognize common problem-solving patterns like two pointers, sliding window, fast/slow pointers, merge intervals, backtracking permutations.  

- **How to Retain What You Learned:**  
  - Repetition is key; revise problems multiple times till concepts move from short-term to long-term memory.  
  - Create revision lists for problems you struggled with and revisit them after intervals for reinforcement.  
  - Bookmark important tutorials, articles, and solutions for quick reference.  

- **Be Consistent:**  
  - Learning DSA takes time; be patient and keep practicing regularly, even if one or two problems daily.  
  - Take breaks if stuck, but don't quit. Set realistic daily or weekly goals.

This structured approach helped Ashish clear interviews at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and can help anyone master DSA efficiently without feeling overwhelmed[1].

The YouTube video titled "How to Start LeetCode from ZERO in 2025" by Ashish Pratap Singh provides a detailed roadmap for beginners who aim to improve in data structures and algorithms (DSA) through LeetCode problems, especially for big tech interviews.



Key points of the video are:



- **Starting Point:** Use LeetCode for DSA practice because it mirrors the style of questions asked by companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. You don't need to switch programming languages if you already know one; Python is recommended for beginners.



- **Fundamentals:** Begin with understanding basics such as time complexity (Big O notation), linear data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables), and sorting, binary search, recursion.



- **Learning Approach:** Focus on one topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed, progressing from easier topics like arrays and strings to more complex ones like trees, hash tables, and graphs.



- **Problem Selection:** Start solving easy problems first to build confidence, then gradually move to medium difficulty problems, which are most common in interviews. Hard problems should be attempted after mastering medium ones.



- **Quality over Quantity:** There is no fixed number of problems to solve, but roughly 300 well-chosen problems with a variety of topics and patterns provide a good preparation base.



- **Practice Tips:** After solving a problem, deeply understand why the solution works rather than memorizing it. Use pen and paper to visualize problems, especially for trees and graphs.



- **Patterns:** Recognize common problem-solving patterns like two pointers, sliding window, recursion, backtracking, and monotonic stack, which can help solve multiple similar problems.



- **Time Management:** Spend 30 to 60 minutes on initially tough problems. For easy problems, aim for 10-15 minutes solutions, and medium problems should ideally be solved within 30 minutes. Participating in timed LeetCode contests is recommended to simulate interview pressure.



- **Revision:** Regularly revisit difficult problems after some time to reinforce learning and improve retention.



- **Resources:** Ashish recommends YouTube channels like Abdul Bari and William Fiset for theory, and his own algomaster.io for DSA patterns and curated LeetCode problems. He also offers free curated problem lists organized by topic and pattern to help track progress.



- **Attitude:** Stay consistent and patient as mastering DSA takes time. Enjoy the process of solving challenges.



This video complements Ashish's previous content by focusing specifically on how to get started with LeetCode effectively from zero, ensuring structured and manageable learning for beginners targeting tech interviews[1].

To approach DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problems effectively, consider these key thinking tips and problem-solving strategies:

1. **Understand the problem deeply**  
   - Read the problem carefully, clarify inputs and outputs.  
   - Identify constraints and edge cases.  
   - Try to rephrase the problem in your own words.

2. **Start with a brute force approach**  
   - First, think of a simple solution even if it is not efficient.  
   - This helps understand the problem and lays foundation to optimize later.

3. **Break down the problem** (Divide and Conquer)  
   - Divide the problem into smaller subproblems.  
   - Solve each subproblem independently, then combine results.

4. **Use common problem-solving paradigms:**
   - **Greedy algorithms:** Make the locally optimal choice at each step.  
   - **Dynamic Programming:** Solve overlapping subproblems and store results to avoid recomputation.  
   - **Backtracking:** Try out all possibilities and backtrack when a path is invalid.  
   - **Sliding Window:** Efficiently handle problems involving contiguous sequences.

5. **Choose the right data structure**  
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, Trees, Graphs each fit different problems.

6. **Analyze time and space complexity**  
   - Aim to reduce complexity after understanding the brute force approach.

7. **Practice pattern recognition**  
   - Many DSA problems follow common patterns such as two pointers, fast/slow pointers, binary search on answer, tree traversal, etc.

8. **Code carefully and test edge cases**  
   - Start coding once the approach is clear.  
   - Test with minimal, maximal, and special inputs to debug.

9. **Optimize incrementally**  
   - Improve from brute force ‚Üí better algorithms ‚Üí efficient data structures.

10. **Learn from solutions and explanations**  
    - Study well-explained solutions to reinforce concepts and learn new tricks.

These are summarized from established best practices and problem-solving strategies frequently used in interviews and competitive programming settings.[1][2][3][4][5][8]
