Do you want me to **also make this into a clean, color-coded PDF schedule** so it looks like a study planner? That would make it much easier to follow visually.


The YouTube video "How I Mastered Data Structures and Algorithms" by Ashish Pratap Singh provides a comprehensive guide and strategy for effectively mastering DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) for coding interviews at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Key points covered in the video for DSA guidance are:

- **Must-Know DSA Topics:**  
  - Data Structures: Linear (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables) and Non-linear (trees, binary search trees, heaps, graphs, trie, union find). Start with linear before nonlinear.  
  - Algorithms: Sorting, binary search, bit manipulation, tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order), graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, topological sort, shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford).  
  - Problem Solving Techniques: Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sum, fast and slow pointers, divide and conquer, greedy, recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, and top k elements techniques.  
  - Optional advanced topics like segment trees and fenwick trees are good to know but not essential initially.  
  - Also important is understanding time and space complexity analysis.

- **Learning Strategy:**  
  - Focus on *one topic at a time* to avoid overwhelm.  
  - Don’t need to fully master a topic before moving on, but understand its core, implement it from scratch, and solve easy related problems on platforms like LeetCode.  
  - Recommended order:  
    1. Linear data structures  
    2. Popular algorithms and problem-solving patterns (two pointers, sliding window, recursion, backtracking, bit manipulation)  
    3. Hierarchical data structures (trees, BST, tries, heaps)  
    4. More complex algorithms (greedy, dynamic programming)  
    5. Graphs and union find.

- **How to Start Learning a New Topic:**  
  1. Learn basics—what it is, code representation, operations, time/space complexity.  
  2. Understand real-world applications (e.g., graphs for Google Maps).  
  3. Visualize with pen and paper—draw diagrams, write pseudocode.  
  4. Implement from scratch in your preferred language.  
  5. Learn built-in libraries for popular data structures in your language.  
  6. Solve easy related problems to build confidence.

- **Mastering a DSA Topic:**  
  1. Prioritize solving problems rather than only theory.  
  2. Challenge yourself with gradually harder problems (easy → medium → hard).  
  3. Understand solutions rather than memorizing them. If stuck, draw or explain the logic to deeply grasp it.  
  4. Think in patterns — recognize common problem-solving patterns like two pointers, sliding window, fast/slow pointers, merge intervals, backtracking permutations.  

- **How to Retain What You Learned:**  
  - Repetition is key; revise problems multiple times till concepts move from short-term to long-term memory.  
  - Create revision lists for problems you struggled with and revisit them after intervals for reinforcement.  
  - Bookmark important tutorials, articles, and solutions for quick reference.  

- **Be Consistent:**  
  - Learning DSA takes time; be patient and keep practicing regularly, even if one or two problems daily.  
  - Take breaks if stuck, but don't quit. Set realistic daily or weekly goals.

This structured approach helped Ashish clear interviews at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and can help anyone master DSA efficiently without feeling overwhelmed[1].

The YouTube video titled "How to Start LeetCode from ZERO in 2025" by Ashish Pratap Singh provides a detailed roadmap for beginners who aim to improve in data structures and algorithms (DSA) through LeetCode problems, especially for big tech interviews.



Key points of the video are:



- **Starting Point:** Use LeetCode for DSA practice because it mirrors the style of questions asked by companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. You don't need to switch programming languages if you already know one; Python is recommended for beginners.



- **Fundamentals:** Begin with understanding basics such as time complexity (Big O notation), linear data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables), and sorting, binary search, recursion.



- **Learning Approach:** Focus on one topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed, progressing from easier topics like arrays and strings to more complex ones like trees, hash tables, and graphs.



- **Problem Selection:** Start solving easy problems first to build confidence, then gradually move to medium difficulty problems, which are most common in interviews. Hard problems should be attempted after mastering medium ones.



- **Quality over Quantity:** There is no fixed number of problems to solve, but roughly 300 well-chosen problems with a variety of topics and patterns provide a good preparation base.



- **Practice Tips:** After solving a problem, deeply understand why the solution works rather than memorizing it. Use pen and paper to visualize problems, especially for trees and graphs.



- **Patterns:** Recognize common problem-solving patterns like two pointers, sliding window, recursion, backtracking, and monotonic stack, which can help solve multiple similar problems.



- **Time Management:** Spend 30 to 60 minutes on initially tough problems. For easy problems, aim for 10-15 minutes solutions, and medium problems should ideally be solved within 30 minutes. Participating in timed LeetCode contests is recommended to simulate interview pressure.



- **Revision:** Regularly revisit difficult problems after some time to reinforce learning and improve retention.



- **Resources:** Ashish recommends YouTube channels like Abdul Bari and William Fiset for theory, and his own algomaster.io for DSA patterns and curated LeetCode problems. He also offers free curated problem lists organized by topic and pattern to help track progress.



- **Attitude:** Stay consistent and patient as mastering DSA takes time. Enjoy the process of solving challenges.



This video complements Ashish's previous content by focusing specifically on how to get started with LeetCode effectively from zero, ensuring structured and manageable learning for beginners targeting tech interviews[1].
