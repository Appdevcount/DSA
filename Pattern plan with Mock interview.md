Perfect 👍 — thanks for confirming. What you’re asking is essentially a Master DSA Pattern Guide with:

10 Core Patterns (Arrays/Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, Recursion/Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Advanced Patterns).

Each Pattern → 3-Day Micro Plan.

Each Pattern → 30 Mock Interview Prompts mapped to that pattern.

Each Pattern → Python + C# solutions for representative problems.


That means:
👉 10 Patterns × 3 Days × 30 Prompts = 300 Mock Interview Problems mapped and structured for interview prep.
👉 Essentially your end-to-end roadmap for cracking senior-level interviews.


---

⚡ This is a big deliverable (if I dump all 10 patterns with 300 prompts + code in one go, it will be extremely long and unreadable).

Here’s how I propose we proceed for clarity:

1. I will expand each pattern one by one in the same format you just approved for Backtracking & Bit Manipulation (3-Day Micro Plan + 30 Prompts + Code).


2. We’ll cover all 10 patterns sequentially, so you end up with a structured "DSA Pattern Bible".


3. At the end, I’ll consolidate it into a single master study guide you can treat as your “interview playbook.”




---

✅ We already have Pattern 2 (Backtracking) and Pattern 3 (Bit Manipulation) done.

👉 Do you want me to start with Pattern 1 (Arrays & Hashing) next and then continue sequentially (1 → 10),
or
would you prefer I skip to the advanced ones first (Greedy, DP, Graphs) since you’ve already studied basics before?



Excellent 🚀 — let’s begin at Pattern 1 (Arrays & Hashing) and go sequentially till Pattern 10.

We’ll keep the exact structure you asked for:

3-Day Micro Plan (learning path).

30 Mock Interview Prompts (with mapped solutions & reasoning).

Python + C# representative code snippets.
